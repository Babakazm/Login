# How to Creat  A User Registration System From Scratch In Python

Welcome to the User Registration System! This Python-based system allows users to register, providing essential information such as their name, age, password, email, and department. Let's dive into how it works:

## Features

1. **User Input and Validation:**
   - Users fill out the registration form with their details.
   - The system validates input (e.g., age as a positive integer, email format, strong passwords).

2. **Unique User ID:**
   - Each user receives a unique ID (generated using UUIDs).
   - This ID serves as their primary key in the database.

3. **Database Interaction:**
   - The system stores user data in an SQLite database.
   - A table called "users" holds columns for name, age, password hash, email, and department.

4. **Security Measures:**
   - Passwords are securely hashed (bcrypt) before storage.
   - SQL injection prevention using parameterized queries.

5. **Feedback to Users:**
   - Successful registration message with the assigned user ID.
   - Error messages for validation failures or existing users.

## Getting Started

1. **Prerequisites:**
   - Python 3.x
   - SQLite (or your preferred database system)

2. **Installation:**
   - Clone this repository.
   - Install required dependencies (if any).

3. **Usage:**
   - Run `python registration_system.py` to start the registration process.
   - Follow the prompts to enter user details.

4. **Contributing:**
   - Contributions are welcome! Fork the repo and submit pull requests.

5. **License:**
   - MIT License (or choose your preferred license).
